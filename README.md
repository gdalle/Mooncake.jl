The goal of the `Mooncake.jl` project is to produce an AD package written entirely in Julia that improves on `ForwardDiff.jl`, `ReverseDiff.jl`, and `Zygote.jl` in several ways.
Please refer to [the docs](https://chalk-lab.github.io/Mooncake.jl/dev) for more info.

> `Mooncake.jl` accepts issues and pull requests pertaining to reproducible defects only. Feature requests, enhancements, redesign proposals, support requests, and debugging requests not accompanied by a minimal reproducible example are outside the scope of this project and will be closed. Mooncake.jl is intended to differentiate through the vast majority of Julia Base and the standard libraries. Known limitations are documented on the [known limitations](https://chalk-lab.github.io/Mooncake.jl/stable/known_limitations/) page. Requests for rules covering functionality outside Julia Base are considered out of scope.

> Mooncake.jl is open-source software developed primarily by academic researchers working within grant-funded institutions. Consequently, our capacity to triage issues and review contributions is necessarily constrained by available resources. Organisations that depend on Mooncake.jl in a commercial or industrial setting are encouraged to consider contributing financially or through direct code contributions.

## Getting Started

Check that you're running a version of Julia that Mooncake.jl supports.
See the `SUPPORT_POLICY.md` file for more info.

There are several ways to interact with `Mooncake.jl`. To interact directly with `Mooncake.jl`, use Mooncake's native API, which allows reuse of prepared caches for repeated gradient and Hessian evaluations:

```julia
import Mooncake as MC

f(x) = (1 - x[1])^2 + 100 * (x[2] - x[1]^2)^2  # Rosenbrock
x = [1.2, 1.2]

# Reverse mode
grad_cache = MC.prepare_gradient_cache(f, x);
val, grad = MC.value_and_gradient!!(grad_cache, f, x)

# Forward mode
fwd_cache = MC.prepare_derivative_cache(f, x);
val_fwd, grad_fwd = MC.value_and_gradient!!(fwd_cache, f, x)

# Hessian
hess_cache = MC.prepare_hessian_cache(f, x);
val, grad, H = MC.value_gradient_and_hessian!!(hess_cache, f, x)
# val  : f(x)
# grad : ∇f(x)  (length-n vector)
# H    : ∇²f(x) (n×n matrix)
```

You should expect that `MC.prepare_gradient_cache` and `MC.prepare_hessian_cache` take a little time to run, but that subsequent calls using the prepared caches are fast.

For details, see the [interface docs](https://chalk-lab.github.io/Mooncake.jl/stable/interface/). You can also interact with `Mooncake.jl` via [`DifferentiationInterface.jl`](https://github.com/gdalle/DifferentiationInterface.jl/), though it may lag behind new features and can break on non-breaking Mooncake releases, as it depends on Mooncake's internal details.
