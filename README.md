The goal of the `Mooncake.jl` project is to produce an AD package written entirely in Julia that improves on `ForwardDiff.jl`, `ReverseDiff.jl`, and `Zygote.jl` in several ways.
Please refer to [the docs](https://chalk-lab.github.io/Mooncake.jl/dev) for more info.

## Getting Started

Check that you're running a version of Julia that Mooncake.jl supports.
See the `SUPPORT_POLICY.md` file for more info.

There are several ways to interact with `Mooncake.jl`. To interact directly with `Mooncake.jl`, use Mooncake's native API, which allows reuse of prepared caches for repeated gradient and Hessian evaluations:

```julia
import Mooncake as MC

f(x) = (1 - x[1])^2 + 100 * (x[2] - x[1]^2)^2  # Rosenbrock
x = [1.2, 1.2]

grad_cache = MC.prepare_gradient_cache(f, x);
val, grad = MC.value_and_gradient!!(grad_cache, f, x)

hess_cache = MC.prepare_hessian_cache(f, x);
val, grad, H = MC.value_gradient_and_hessian!!(hess_cache, f, x)
# val  : f(x)
# grad : ∇f(x)  (length-n vector)
# H    : ∇²f(x) (n×n matrix)
```

You should expect that `MC.prepare_gradient_cache` and `MC.prepare_hessian_cache` take a little bit of time to run, but that repeated calls using the prepared caches are fast.

For additional details, see the [interface docs](https://chalk-lab.github.io/Mooncake.jl/stable/interface/). You can also interact with `Mooncake.jl` via  [`DifferentiationInterface.jl`](https://github.com/gdalle/DifferentiationInterface.jl/).

```julia
import DifferentiationInterface as DI

backend = DI.AutoMooncake()
grad_cache = DI.prepare_gradient(f, backend, x);
g = DI.gradient(f, grad_cache, backend, x)
```

We generally recommend interacting with `Mooncake.jl` through `DifferentiationInterface.jl`, although this interface may lag behind Mooncake in supporting newly introduced features.
